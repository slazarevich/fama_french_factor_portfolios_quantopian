The repository contains the source code used in "Investing in quantitative factor portfolios using Quantopian". The study examines the potential of using factors described by Fama and French (2015) in their Five-factor asset pricing model for the purpose of long-term hands-off portfolio management.

In order to run a strategy simulation, one should copy and paste the contents of "Algorithm template.py" to the Algorithms research environment on Quantopian. The comments within the code explain how to change simulation parameters.

The files MULTIFACTOR.htm and notebook.ipynb are both the same template (in a different format) used for Aplhalens factor analysis. MULTIFACTOR.htm is a browser-friendly version of the notebook that can be viewed only. notebook.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file that can be imported directly into the Quantopian's Notebook research environment.
